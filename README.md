# CPU Emulator in CPP

This is a project that aims to emulate the 8-bit 6502 CPU in C++. The 6502 is a famous microprocessor that powered many classic computers and consoles, such as the Apple II, the Commodore 64, and the Nintendo Entertainment System. This project is not a full implementation of the 6502, but rather a learning exercise to understand how a CPU works by writing an emulator from scratch.
